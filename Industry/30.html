				<p>Simple interest calculation method</p><p>Generally, simple interest will only use the &quot;initial principal&quot; as the basis for calculating interest. The calculation formula is as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sum of principal and interest = principal × interest rate × time</p><p>(Unless specifically emphasized, the above interest rates usually refer to the &quot;annual interest rate&quot;)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In real life, although it can be divided into monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual interest payments according to different products, it does not have much impact on the calculation of simple interest. For example:</p><p>Both product A and product B are 10,000&nbsp;USD&nbsp;commodities with an interest rate of 12%.</p><p>However, product A pays interest once a month, and product B pays interest once a year.</p><p>§ The interest per period of product A is: 10,000×(12%/12) = 100&nbsp;USD, monthly interest is 100&nbsp;USD, and annual interest is 1,200&nbsp;USD</p><p>§ The interest per period of product B is: 10,000×12% = 1,200&nbsp;USD, and the annual interest is 1,200&nbsp;USD</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It can be seen that the total amount of interest for product A and product B is the same,</p><p>The only difference is that product A will receive part of the interest earlier and can be used for distribution as soon as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Compound interest calculation method</p><p>Compound interest is based on the current &quot;total capital&quot; as the basis for calculating interest.</p><p>That is to say, the previously accumulated interest will also be included in the calculation of subsequent interest to achieve the so-called &quot; money breeds money&quot;. The calculation formula is as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sum of principal and interest = principal × (1+interest rate per period) ^ number of periods (number of interest accruals)</p><p>(Interest rate per period = annual interest rate / number of interest accruals per year)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At this time, the difference in the monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and one-year interest payments of the product will affect the &quot;period interest rate&quot; and &quot;period number&quot; in the compound interest calculation. For example:</p><p>For a product with an annual interest rate of 12%, in the case of monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and one-year interest rates, the initial principal investment is 10,000 USD. The sum of principal and interest after one year is calculated as follows:</p><p>§ Annual interest: 10,000 × (1+12%)1 = 11,200</p><p>§ The interest is calculated in half a year: 10,000 × (1+12%/2)2 = 11,236</p><p>§ Quarterly interest: 10,000 × (1+12%/4)⁴ = 11,255</p><p>§ Monthly interest: 10,000 × (1+12%/12)12 = 11,268</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The results of the four interest calculation methods are different. If the limit is one year, it can be seen that the more interest calculation times a year, the greater the result.</p><p>And if the number of years is extended to ten years, this situation will be more obvious:</p><p>§ Annual interest: 10,000 × (1+12%)1⁰ = 31,058</p><p>§ Interest calculated in half a year: 10,000 × (1+12%/2)2⁰ = 32,071</p><p>§ Quarterly interest: 10,000 × (1+12%/4)⁴⁰ = 32,620</p><p>§ Monthly interest: 10,000 × (1+12%/12)12⁰ = 33,003</p><p>§ (Simple interest calculation: 10,000 × 12% × 10 = 12,000-the profit from the compound interest effect is far better than the simple interest)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It can be seen that: &quot;If the time is stretched, the plan with more interest accrues, the more the sum of capital and interest will be obtained in the end!&quot;</p><p>Therefore, &quot;compound interest effect + long-term accumulation&quot; is the basic standard configuration, and its essence and power can be seen.</p><p>To describe the sum of principal and interest in one sentence: &quot;Simple interest calculation is linear growth, compound interest calculation is exponential growth!&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Comparison of simple interest and compound interest: &quot;Simple interest is linear growth, while compound interest is exponential growth.&quot;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which investment products can create compound interest effects?</p><p>According to the current investment market, the following four products are ways to create compound interest effects (please leave a message to provide other subject matter...):</p><p>1. Bank interest</p><p>2. Savings insurance, such as whole life insurance, annuity insurance, pension insurance, etc., all fall into this category.</p><p>3. Regular fixed-amount fund</p><p>4. The annualized rate of return of the market ETF (stock)</p><p>5. Cryptocurrency second contract transaction</p>
